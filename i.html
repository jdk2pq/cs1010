<b>October 2001</b> - The first ever iPod is released; original retail value: $399. While it was an incredibly well-designed device and gained much popularity immediately, the high price tag was a deterrent.<br><br>

<b>January 2002</b> - The iMac is redesigned to be a flat-panel computer. In addition, Apple looks for interesting ways to advertise Apple devices, encouraging PC users to switch by filming real conversations with real PC-to-Mac switchers.<br><br>

<b>January 2003</b> - iLife is released, including iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, and iDVD. This suite of software allows Mac users to interact with their other digital devices in new and unique ways, attracting a new sort of culture towards Apple.<br><br>

<b>April-October 2003</b> - The iTunes Music Store officially opens. Beginning on Macs and soon opening up to Windows users, iTunes holds a monopoly on the digital music business, especially with iPod sales skyrocketing.<br><br>

<b>2004</b> - With a large control over digital music sales, Apple shifts a lot of its focus to developing the iPod and creating a unique user experience with iDevices and iSoftware. The iPod Mini, iPod Photo, iPod U2 Special Edition, and the iPod with unique touch scroll wheel are all released to the public. In addition, an all-in-one, redesigned, flatscreen iMac is released in August, upgrading the speed, memory, operating system, and look-and-feel of the machine.<br><br>

<b>2005</b> - Apple continues pushing the iTunes Music Store and the iPod, releasing the iPod Shuffle, a slimmed down and low-priced mp3 player meant for working out, the new iPod minis, the iPod Color, the iPod Nano, and the iPod Video. In addition, the Mac Mini is released, reminiscent of the Apple Cube, but much improved since the release of the Cube, and a new line of iBooks and iMacs.<br><br>
<b>2006</b> - Apple rebrands their line of laptops as MacBooks, advertising the many new features of the very advanced operating system, OSX. New generations of the iPod Nano and Shuffle are released, along with updated lines of Apple computers to continue to have the most cutting-edge hardware.<br><br>

<b>2007</b> - No doubt remains that Apple has become a superpower in modern technology. Fanboys, cultures, cults, blogs, newsfeeds, forums, and more all appear and focus on one thing: What will Apple do next? One major rumor is confirmed in 2007 with the releases of the first-ever iPhone and iPod Touch.<br><br>

<b>2008-The Present</b> - With a solid line of products already released, Apple advances each product further and further, with a couple of new devices released during this time. The MacBook Air, a record-breakingly thin laptop, is released in 2008, and in 2010, the iPad is released. Both devices prove to be risky releases for Apple, as they are the first on the market to become popular, but with Apple's great focus on users having the best and most unique user experience when using their devices, the devices are major successes.
