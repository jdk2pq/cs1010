<div id="content_container"> <div id="content2"><div id="bannerphoto"><img src="banner.png" width =700 height=80 alt="The Rise of Apple"></div><br><b>April 1, 1976</b> - Apple Computers is born. Steve Wozniak creates the Apple I, and Steve Jobs, a close friend of Wozniak, becomes the driving force behind getting the machine sold.<br><br>
<b>1977-78</b> - Apple creates the Apple II, a machine which garners attention at local computer trade shows, as well as the Apple Disk II, the most inexpensive floppy disk drive at the time.<br><br>
<b>1980</b> - The Apple III is released, and the company begins to pick up more speed than ever before, with many more employees, a board of directors, new investors, and a greater volume of sales.<br><br>
<b>1981-1983</b> - Apple begins work on the Lisa, as well as the Macintosh, and both computers shape Apple's future. In addition, John Sculley becomes President and CEO of Apple in April 1983.<br><br>
<b>January 22nd, 1984</b> - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OYecfV3ubP8">This ad</a> for the Macintosh is shown during the Super Bowl, with the first-ever Macintosh being released two days later. <br><br>
<b>1985</b> - Voted out by the Board of Directors, Steve Jobs resigns and leaves Apple.<br><br>
<b>1985-1987</b> - Microsoft steals bits of GUI from Apple, using it in Windows 1.0, and Bill Gates and Sculley reach an agreement to stop the use of Mac code in Microsoft software. In addition, Apple comes back out on top in 1987 by releasing the Mac II, a very high-selling computer for publishers and personal computing. <br><br>
<b>1990</b> - Apple fears the enormous growth of Microsoft and considers licensing its OS to reach more consumers but decides against the idea.<br><br>
<b>1991-1993</b> - The first PowerBook laptops are released, as well as the Newton, a PDA by Apple, and both gain much attention for apple, despite the Newton having poor handwriting recognition. Sculley resigns as CEO, and Michael Spindler takes his spot.<br><br>
<b>1993-1996</b> - Although the PowerMac series, based off the PowerPC chip, is released, Mac OS is licensed to a few companies, and the Performa is released, Apple does not perform well during this period and loses a lot of money due to not having enough parts to build all the computers ordered. In addition, Spindler proves to be a unsuccessful CEO and is replaced by Gil Amelio in 1996.<br><br></div>
