<b>1996</b> - With Amelio leading the company, Apple sees much less of a loss than what many financial experts predicted. However, Apple still needs a change in the company structure in order to survive.<br><br>
<b>December 1996</b> - Apple buys NeXT from Steve Jobs, and Jobs returns to working at Apple. In addition, the software and hardware Jobs developed during his time at NeXT is used for future Apple product releases. The merger of NeXT and Apple allows Apple to grow further than ever. <br><br>
<b>1997</b> - Jobs does not resume his position as CEO but is instead given a large role within the company. He becomes the face of Apple, giving many keynote speeches, announcing new company policies and goals, and finally reaching an agreement with Microsoft over the battle of Windows using parts of the Mac GUI. Lastly, Jobs closes off all companies that cloned Apple computers by buying out the license agreements Apple had sold. This move shows exactly why the Mac Operating System, as well as Apple hardware, is so closed-off to other companies. Jobs attempts (and succeeds) at making Apple an independent and direct company, not needing licenses to survive or expand its business.<br><br>
<b>1998</b> - The Apple Store grows in popularity and pushes Apple even further as a company. In addition, Jobs unexpectedly announces Mac OS X in April, describing it as a mixture between the old OS 8 technologies and the more advanced operating system Apple had been working on, code-named Rhapsody. Finally, the iMac is released, and more affordable Apple machines follow soon after. Sales reach a new record high for Apple due to the release of the iMac.<br><br>
<b>July 1999</b> - The iBook is released, incorporating the same ideas as the iMac. Both computers are very affordable to the consumer, sport a high-quality operating system for all users, and have a beautiful design to them, even on the outside. The i- branding begins to become a staple of Apple products. A new PowerMac is also released, bringing even more power to professional users of Apple products.<br><br>
<b>January 2000</b> - Steve Jobs officially resumes his position as CEO of Apple and announces a new set of Mac-specific iTools to access the Web, furthering Apple's use of branding their products with an i.<br><br>
<b> July 2000</b> - Despite all of this great success for Apple and Steve Jobs resuming leadership of the company, Apple takes a risk and releases a device that fails, the PowerMac G4 Cube. The Cube was only a computer, with no monitor attached. This led to Apple creating more devices that stunned consumers based on how much power the device had in such a small amount of space. The Cube also led to the release of the Mac Mini. Unfortunately, the market was not ready for The Cube at the time of release.<br><br>
<b>2000-2001</b> - Apple works on a strategy to attract users of the new and popular emerging technology of the early 21st century. A suite of software will begin to accompany Mac OSX and give users of mp3 players, digital cameras, CD's and DVD's, and other devices excellent ways of managing and interacting with the data on the devices. In this way, having a Mac means someone uses computers for leisure and fun, rather than just for professional tasks. This new strategy creates the iCulture.
